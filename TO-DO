                         TclX bug, idea and task list

o Rename all to all.tcl

switch to using Tcl's save/restore result functionality./

*** Porting to 8.1 ***

o merge in init.tcl changes!!!!

O tcl>auto_packages
  Error: no value given for parameter "cmd" to "auto_load"

o ::FSSP and FSSP autoload are not equiv.

o Is Tcl_EvalObjv useful to us?

Have try_eval create an errorSave so one can do eval error $errorSave

o Boyer-Moore is not being used.

o option to command loop to quit on an error or something like that
  (callback?, both?)

o EvalFilePart should do everything Tcl_Eval files does with
  objects.

*** Serious Bugs ***

o Peter-Klaus Schilling <pks@mail.desy.de>
    INSTALL.generic says:
    [..]
       In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
    options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
    kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
    you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
    [..]

    However, this doesn't work for me.

o   From: jph@solo.com (Jean-Pierre Hebert)
    I am put off not being able to say:
            translit A-z "" $foo 
    or similar anymore. This was very handy.
    Is that a bug or a new feature?
    Any workaround to suggest?

o Results of "runtest nonexistant-file" is bogus.  errorInfo is never
  getting set, as Tcl_EvalFile does not set errorInfo if file can't
  be opened

o cmdtrace usage message includes garbage after args: .

o Should mainloop call exit when no more events?

o replicate doesn't take an expression

o asserts are caused the gnu eprintf problems.

o loop i 0 1 {error arf}
   Tcl_AppendStringsToObj called with shared object

o objcmd writing man page not installed.

o TclX creates a global variable `e'

*** Minor bugs and enhancements ***

o detect .tndx file that doesn't have anything in it.

From: ellson@hotair.hobl.lucent.com
    Just a small gripe.   Could you please arrange the tclX Makefiles
    so that they don't depend on libtcl8.0.so in tcl's build area?
    This is causing me some problems when building tclX on my laptop with 
    limited disk space.  You should be able to use the installed versions
    of the libraries so that the tcl and tk build areas can be kept clean.

o Umask command should return old umask if it sets its.

o add man compress install
o Need to either document how namspaces are used in #@package or normalize
  them as with auto_qualify.  

o Added --with-tcl and --with-tk dir
  (requested by sstanton@ghostwheel.Eng.Sun.COM)
    >You might want to take a look at the configuration files for expect.  It does 
    >a great job of handling this case, including looking for internal Tcl header 
    >files, etc.
o Allow configure to work from other directories.

o Better doc on package require.

o Testing of package require in test scripts.

o Add math functions for string compares ceq(), clt, cgt and for
  list compares?

o Convert sleep command to use Tcl_Sleep.  Perhaps just convert it to
  a proc that calls after.

o Use Tcl_RegExpCompile and Tcl_RegExpExec.

o Use install-sh for installation.

o tkdemo proc is not installed.

o tclhelp is not built for windows.

o syslog interface.  Commands that give explicit access to syslog, plus
  a channel that lets one write to syslog.  Should be able to dup channel
  to have both stdout and stderr go to the same channel.  Need a dup
  fconfigure option.

o Making packages out of some of the new TclX functionallity, such as 
  syslog idea above.

o Install instructions for WinDozes.

o Help change to search for file path tail needs documented and tests.

o lvarset listvar idx value

From: Tom Poindexter <tpoindex@nyx.net>

I've just written a Tcl 8.0 interface for FastCGI.  It's in 100% Tcl, using
TclX for the case where the FastCGI app is spawned by the web server (Apache).
The spawned FastCGI process gets a socket as file descriptor 0.  Tcl
makes fd 0 into a File channel, but 'server_accept' is content just to
extract the fd from the channel, and perform an accept().
